About Code Cairns
============================

In the mountains, cairns are rock piles left by previous travelers as trail markers.
Most often found off-trail, they point the way others have walked.

This is the spirit of Code Cairns. It's not meant to be authoritative: this is not the officially sanctioned path.
Rather, recorded here are ways I have passed through the shifting |talus field| that is our technology landscape.

They may work for you as-is, or with some tweaking, or they may not work at all. 

The value is in sharing a thought process, and in recording field notes which,
in the best case scenario, will help others get where they're headed faster.
