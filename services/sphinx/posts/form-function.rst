Form Function
=============

Here's what I learned from packaging the Adipress.

The housing of the device itself.

The presentation of the device at an international conference.

Why I think it's worth digging into style.

But form should follow function, which is why the flask page has a different style from the sphinx theme.

This gets at the deeper question. Cynically, we might say that design is just a plot to capture our focus
in the ever-growing link attention economy.

But perhaps there is something deeper at play. Perhaps form actually helps us interact with information
meaningfully.

And finally, my tools: While there are certain sitations where graphic design tools are unavoidable
(such as the logo image for this page, which I retouched from a photo),
I don't see myself as a information designer per se (but if you're curious Eleanor Lutz is my favorite).

I prefer investing my time in programatic tools such as CSS, because that feels like an investment
compounding skill sets. While I'll never turn down a deep dive on a weekend craft project, I've learned
over time that working hours are a scarce and precious commodity, and we should invest it (note, I didn't
say "spend") on compounding efforts. As they say, "don't learn to iron a shirt unless you want to keep doing it."

Actually, that's (link) Why I chose to blog with Sphinx.
